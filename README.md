## Project Overview
With rising fuel costs in Nigeria and increased interest in alternative energy sources, many vehicle owners are considering converting their vehicles from Petrol Motor Spirit (PMS) to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). This project evaluates whether CNG conversion is financially worthwhile by comparing fuel costs, monthly spending, savings, and payback periods across different vehicle categories, engine types, and brands.
The analysis is designed to answer one core question:
Is CNG truly cheaper than PMS in real-world usage, and how long does it take to recover the conversion cost?
