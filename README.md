## Project Overview
With rising fuel costs in Nigeria and increased interest in alternative energy sources, many vehicle owners are considering converting their vehicles from Petrol Motor Spirit (PMS) to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). This project evaluates whether CNG conversion is financially worthwhile by comparing fuel costs, monthly spending, savings, and payback periods across different vehicle categories, engine types, and brands.

The analysis is designed to answer one core question:
Is CNG truly cheaper than PMS in real-world usage, and how long does it take to recover the conversion cost?


## Business Context
Nigeria’s transportation sector is highly sensitive to fuel price changes. While CNG is often promoted as a cheaper and cleaner alternative, conversion requires a significant upfront investment. Vehicle owners, fleet operators, and policymakers need clear, data-backed insights to understand:
1. How fuel efficiency differs between PMS and CNG
2. How monthly fuel spending compares under a fixed driving distance
3. Whether conversion costs can be recovered within a reasonable timeframe

This project simulates a realistic decision-making scenario using standardized assumptions to support fair comparison.
